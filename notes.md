BEST MAE for different approaches

grid search hyperparams - 125 (can dive into functions more)

xgb - 86 (5 80:20 splits)

ensemble of models - 80 
regression isnt intended way to solve this but good safety and benchmark to beat
time to focus on building a mathmatical model

nueral net -  82.24 Â± 4.23

past halfway and still no improvement on the 125 for mathmatical models
